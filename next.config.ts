  // requires when bundling for the client.
  //
  // `fs` has no legitimate browser use anywhere in this app, so it's stubbed
  // to a no-op. `path` is different: contextEnginer's ImportResolver does
  // real `path.posix.dirname`/`.join` calls at runtime to resolve import
  // graphs — aliasing it to the same empty stub would make every import
  // resolution silently throw, which would make the context engine's
  // graph/dependency features fail every time (falling back to naive
  // behavior) without ever surfacing an error. path-browserify implements
  // the real API using only string manipulation, so it's safe in a browser
  // and keeps that code actually working.
